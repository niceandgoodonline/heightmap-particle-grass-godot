# Heightmap Particle Grass/Foliage

This project contains a prototype framework for particle based heightmap derived grass/foliage in Godot 4.x (built with 4.2)

The goal of this framework is to make high density grass/foliage more accessible and easier to iterate on.

## Example

I made a few [short videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63pCzCYNcho&list=PL6L8fuv--ZUylP4po6skuiYbNbWeCZd8f) to serve as very high level documentation and also a how-to-use quick start. Not everything is covered in these videos but the basics are.

This framework is based on [Zestfulfibre Wanderclipmap Foliage Particle Process](https://godotshaders.com/author/zestfulfibre/).

Currently supports (and includes) [Zylann's heightmap plugin](https://github.com/Zylann/godot_heightmap_plugin). A version which supports other heightmap terrain plugins is possible (as well as supporting custom solutions).

The demo uses [HungryProton's Monitor Overlay](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/1280) to give performance feedback on screen.

The demo also includes [acegiak's Climb'n'Glide Character Controller](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/1472).
